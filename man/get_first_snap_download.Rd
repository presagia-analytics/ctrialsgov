\title{Retrieve the First Available Snapshot Download After a Specified Date}
\usage{
get_first_snap_download(year, month)
}
\arguments{
\item{year}{Integer. The year for which to search snapshot downloads.}

\item{month}{Integer (1â€“12). The month for which to search.}
}
\value{
A tibble containing the snapshot download record for the first
  snapshot date on or after the input year and month. If none exists
  for December, it will recursively look at January of the following year.
}
\description{
This function returns the first snapshot download record of a given
**year** and **month**, based on the snapshot dates. If the month falls
in the future relative to the current date, it throws an error. For
dates at the end of the year where no snapshot exists, it will attempt
to fetch the first snapshot of the next year.
}
\details{
This function uses `get_snap_downloads_by_year()` to fetch all snapshot
downloads for the specified year, arranges them by `snap_date`, and
filters to keep the first entry on or after the start of the specified month.
If no entry exists and the month is December, it recurses to the next year.

It will abort with a CLI-friendly message if the requested year/month
lies in the future relative to `Sys.Date()`.

# Assuming snapshot data exists for these dates:
get_first_snap_download(2025, 5)
get_first_snap_download(2025, 12)
